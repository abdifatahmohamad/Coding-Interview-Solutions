Explanation with Example

Input: strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
Output: "fl"

Initialization and Edge Case Check:

if not strs:
return ""

If the input list is empty, return an empty string. In this case, strs is not empty, so we proceed.

Initialize the Longest Common Prefix:

longest_prefix = ""

Initialize the variable longest_prefix as an empty string.

Iterate Over Each Character Index of the First String:

for i in range(len(strs[0])):
ch = strs[0][i]

Iterate over each character index i of the first string "flower". For each index, ch is set to the character at that index.

Compare the Character with Corresponding Characters in All Other Strings:

for j in range(1, len(strs)):
if i >= len(strs[j]) or strs[j][i] != ch:
return longest_prefix

For each character ch from the first string, iterate over all other strings starting from index 1.
If the current index i is out of bounds for any string or if the character at index i in any string does not match ch, return the current longest_prefix.

Add Matching Character to the Prefix:

longest_prefix += ch

If the character ch matches in all strings, append it to longest_prefix.

Return the Longest Common Prefix Found:

return longest_prefix

After the loop completes, return the longest_prefix.

Step-by-Step Example with Given Input:

First Character ('f'):
Compare 'f' from "flower", "flow", and "flight".
All strings have 'f' at index 0.
Add 'f' to longest_prefix. Now, longest_prefix is "f".

Second Character ('l'):
Compare 'l' from "flower", "flow", and "flight".
All strings have 'l' at index 1.
Add 'l' to longest_prefix. Now, longest_prefix is "fl".

Third Character ('o'):
Compare 'o' from "flower" and "flow".
"flight" has 'i' at index 2, which does not match 'o'.
Return the current longest_prefix, which is "fl".

Thus, the longest common prefix among "flower", "flow", and "flight" is "fl".
